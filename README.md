 - cycle : phrase looper
 - periodic : stepped simple harmonic motion
 - rand : linear, gaussian and random walk

 - out : stereo audio output with reverb

A User Guide, Help files, and Examples are included.

Functions are based on live coding techniques outlined in Sorensen, Andrew & Brown, Andrew R. (2007) [aa-cell in practice: An approach to musical live coding.](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/39768/1/c39768.pdf) In: Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference. pp. 292â€“299.
