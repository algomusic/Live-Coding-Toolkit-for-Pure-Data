# Live Coding Toolkit for Pure Data
 A suite of Pure Data abstractions (predefined functions) for musical live coding

 Download and add the folder to your Paths in Pure Data's preferences.

 Abstractions include:
 - tempo : send bangs regularly at a particular BPM
 - cycle : phrase looper
 - periodic : stepped simple harmonic motion
 - euclid : euclidean rhythm generator
 - randchord : generate and store a randomised chord
 - randseq : generate and store a randomised number sequence
 - defer : schedule an event into the future by a number of beats
 - ramp : stepped transition between two values
 - rand : linear, gaussian and random walk
 - direct : pass input values to a specified outlet
 - quant : pitch class quanitze
 - midi : MIDI note output and MIDI note and control change input
 - map : scales data from one range to another
 - gate : probabilistically let data through or not
 - synth~ : simple mono subtractive synth
 - polysynth~ : 8 voice version of synth~
 - fm~ : simple 2-operator frequency modulation synth
 - polyfm~ : 8 voice version of fm~
 - drums~ : simple synthesized drum kit
 - sample~ : load and playback a mono audio file
 - polysample~ : 8 voice version of sample~
 - echo~ : stereo audio feedback delay
 - gate~ : probabilistically let audio through or not
 - gain~ : stereo audio gain control with mute
 - panner~ : stereo audio panner
 - out~ : stereo audio output with reverb

A User Guide, Help files, and Examples are included.

Functions are based on live coding techniques outlined in Sorensen, Andrew & Brown, Andrew R. (2007) [aa-cell in practice: An approach to musical live coding.](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/39768/1/c39768.pdf) In: Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference. pp. 292â€“299.
