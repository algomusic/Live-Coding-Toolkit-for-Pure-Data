- inlets [step, numb of steps, centre value, range]
- outlet [next value]

randseq : generate and store and randomised number sequence
- arguments (numb of steps, random range, offset, multiply)
- inlets [bang to generate seq, numb of steps, random range, offset, multiply, bang to send seq]
- outlet [list of seq data]

defer : schedule an event into the future by a number of beats
- arguments (bpm, number of beats to wait)
- inlets [data, bpm, number of beats to wait]
- outlet [delayed data]

ramp : stepped transition between two values
- arguments (numb of steps, start value, end value, curve)
- inlets [step, numb of steps, start value, end value, curve, reset]
- outlet [next value, bang on last step]

rand : linear, gaussian and random walk
- arguments (centre, deviation, upper limit, lower limit)
- inlets [trigger bang, centre/start value, deviation value, lower limit, upper limit]
- outlets [linear distribution, gaussian distribution, random walk]

direct : pass input values to a specified outlet
- arguments (outlet number from 0 to 3)
- inlets [value, outlet number from 0 to 3]
- outlet [outlet 0, outlet 1, outlet 2, outlet 3]

quant : pitch class quanitze
- arguments (list of up to 11 MIDI pitch numbers ranged from 0-11)
- inlets [MIDI pitch to quantize, pitch class list]
- outlet [quantised MIDI pitch]

midi : MIDI note send and note and control change receive
- arguments (MIDI send velocity, send duration in ms, MIDI send channel from 1 to 16, receive control change number)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, duration in ms, MIDI channel from 1 to 16, set cc number to receive]
- outlets [received pitch, received velocity, received cc val (0-127), scaled received cc value (0-1)]

map : scales data from one range to another
- arguments (input min, input max, output min, output max)
- inlets [value to be scaled, input min, input max, output min, output max]
- outlet [scaled value]

synth : simple mono subtractive synth
- arguments (filter cutoff, attack in ms, release in ms, glide in ms)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, filter cutoff, attack in ms, release in ms, glide in ms]

- outlet [left audio signal, right audio signal]

fm : simple 2-operator frequency modulation synth
- arguments (mod index, C:M ratio, attack in ms, release in ms)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, modulation index, carrier:modulator ratio, attack in ms, release in ms]
- outlet [mono audio signal]

polyfm : 8 voice version of fm
- arguments (mod index, C:M ratio, attack in ms, release in ms)
- inlets [pitch, velocity, mod index, C:M ratio, attack in ms, release in ms]
- outlet [left audio signal, right audio signal]

drums : simple synthesized drum kit
- arguments (none)
- inlets [kick trigger, snare trigger, hats trigger, kick level from 0 - 1, snare level, hats level]
- outlet [mono audio signal]

gain : stereo audio gain control with mute
- arguments (level 0-1)
- inlets [left audio input, right audio input], level 0-1, mute 0 or 1]
- outlet [left audio signal, right audio signal]]

panner : stereo audio panner
- arguments (pan position 0-1)
