Live Coding Toolkit for Pure Data - User Guide

A suite of Pure Data abstractions (predefined functions) for musical live coding

By Andrew R. Brown, 2021

Abstractions:

cycle : phrase looper
- arguments (pitch, velocity, duration, delay, transpose)
- inlets [trigger bangs, pitch list, velocity list, duration list, delay in ms, transpose in semitones, restart count]
- outlets [next pitch, next velocity, next duration, beat count, pulse count]

periodic : stepped simple harmonic motion
- arguments (numb of steps, centre value, range)
- inlets [step, numb of steps, centre value, range]
- outlet [next value]

ramp : stepped transition between two values
- arguments (numb of steps, start value, end value, curve)
- inlets [step, numb of steps, start value, end value, curve, reset]
- outlet [next value]

rand : linear, gaussian and random walk
- arguments (centre, deviation, upper limit, lower limit)
- inlets [trigger bang, value 1, value 2, upper limit, lower limit]
- outlets [linear distribution, gaussian distribution, random walk (centre = start, deviation = step size, upper limit, lower limit)]

quant : pitch class quanitze
- arguments (list of up to 11 MIDI pitch numbers ranged from 0-11)
- inlets [MIDI pitch to quantize, pitch class list]
- outlet [quantised MIDI pitch]

midi : MIDI note output
- arguments (MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, duration in ms, MIDI channel from 1 to 16)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, duration in ms, MIDI channel from 1 to 16]
- outlets [none]

synth : simple mono subtractive synth
- arguments (filter cutoff, attack in ms, release in ms)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, filter cutoff, attack in ms, release in ms]
- outlet [mono audio signal]

fm : simple 2-operator frequency modulation synth
- arguments (mod index, C:M ratio, attack in ms, release in ms)
- inlets [MIDI pitch, MIDI velocity, modulation index, carrier:modulator ratio, attack in ms, release in ms]
- outlet [mono audio signal]

drums : simple synthesized drum kit
- arguments (none)
- inlets [kick trigger, snare trigger, hats trigger, kick velocity from 0 - 127, snare velocity, hats velocity]
- outlet [mono audio signal]

panner : stereo audio panner
- arguments (none)
- inlets [audio signal, pan position from 0.0 - 1.0]
- outlets [audio out left, audio out right]

out : stereo audio output with reverb
- arguments (none)
- inlets (audio input left, audio input right, volume level from 0.0 to 1.0, reverb amount from 0 tp 100)
- outlets [none]
